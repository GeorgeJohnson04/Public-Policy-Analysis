# Policy Memo Project

## Overview
This repository contains an individual policy memo project for POLC 3322, following Bardach’s Eightfold Path for Policy Analysis. The project consists of four parts and evaluates a public policy problem, assessing multiple policy alternatives and their projected outcomes.

## Project Structure
- **Policy Memo Part 1**: Introduction to the policy problem and its context.
- **Policy Memo Part 2**: Evaluation of multiple policy alternatives.
- **Policy Memo Part 3**: Quantitative analysis of policy impacts.
- **Policy Memo Part 4** (Upcoming): Final recommendations and conclusions.

## Policy Analysis Framework
The memo adheres to the Eightfold Path framework:
1. Define the Problem
2. Assemble the Evidence
3. Construct the Alternatives
4. Select the Criteria
5. Project the Outcomes
6. Confront the Trade-offs
7. Decide
8. Tell Your Story

## Replicating the Donald Trump Policy Analysis in R
This project builds upon a previous analysis conducted in MATLAB that examined the economic impacts of Donald Trump’s tax and tariff policies. The original model has been adapted and transformed into R for this study, utilizing **ggplot2** for visualization and quantitative policy assessment.

Key transformations from MATLAB to R include:
- **Economic modeling** of GDP, wealth concentration, and policy shifts using R functions.
- **Elasticity-based projections** for GDP and wealth disparity.
- **Data visualization** using `ggplot2` instead of MATLAB’s plotting functions.

## Data Analysis
The project uses R for quantitative analysis, specifically leveraging **ggplot2** for visualizing the effects of policy shifts on GDP, GDP per capita, and wealth disparity. The analysis includes:
- **Modeling the economic impact** of tax and tariff changes.
- **Projecting GDP changes** using elasticity factors.
- **Evaluating wealth disparity shifts** based on policy adjustments.

### Key Code Features:
- GDP projections based on elasticity models.
- Wealth concentration shifts under different policy scenarios.
- Data visualization to compare policy impacts.

## Requirements
To run the R analysis, install the required package:
```r
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## Submission Details
- **Course:** POLC 3322
- **Assignment:** Individual Policy Memo Project - Final Draft (150 points, 15% of grade)
- **Due Date:** April 5, 2025, 11:59 PM

## Future Work
The final part of this project will include a comprehensive evaluation of trade-offs and a final policy recommendation based on the projected outcomes.
